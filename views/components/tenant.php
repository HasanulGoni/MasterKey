            Tenant-Occupied Maintenance refers to the repair and upkeep services provided for properties that are currently occupied by tenants. These services ensure that the property remains in good condition while minimizing disruption to the tenant’s daily life. It’s a key part of effective property management, helping maintain both tenant satisfaction and property value.
